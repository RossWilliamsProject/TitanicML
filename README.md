# TitanicML
This project is a Jupyter Notebook that was created in order to compete in a python machine learning module compeititon on "kaggle" - and is based around accurately predicted passengers survival on the titanic based on their position, socioeconomic background, gender, etc. The notebook is split into 9 parts, the most important being data cleaning, analysis, and modelling.

The data cleaning mostly involved ordinal encoding and filling missing values. Data analysis was more complex - visualisations to justify analysis points were created using seaborn and pandas. The modelling for this project involved fitting several models using the training data (such as K nearet neighbours, logistic regression, and 4 others) using SkLearn, and simply comparing accuracy scores.

This is the most basic of the data science projects I have completed, so does not contain some important parts of machine learning present in other projects, such as feature engineering, and evaluation tools such as SHAP values and cross validatio
